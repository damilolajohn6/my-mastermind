## Task
the problem came when i wrote the first program using the scanf function and the challenge came when
i have to use the read function.

## Description
i am able to solve the problem with the read function and randomly generating numbers.

## Installation
Since i am working on a C project, Installation works when you put the neccesary header.

## Usage
my program when you input the correct number from a randomly generated number in the game.
I designed the program to randomly generate a number which is displayed, and after the user enters The
incorrect number it shows where you have a well placed pieces and a misplaced pieces.
